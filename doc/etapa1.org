In this file we'll provide a small account of the implementation process
underwent until the release date.

* Objective

The first stage outlined a lexical analyzer (lexer) that achieves the
following goals to this release:

- line count;
- ignore comments;
- throw lexical errors;
- match tokens
  - reserved keywords;
  - special characters;
  - composite operators;
  - identifiers;
  - string and decimal literals.

The tool that would enable us to achieve that is =flex=, the Fast Lexical
Analyzer, part of the GNU's toolbox.
